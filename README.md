# What Is Timber?



![](.gitbook/assets/logo-purple.png)

[Timber](https://timber.io/) is a hosted service for aggregating logs across your entire stack - [any language, any platform, any data source](usage/integrations/). Timber is designed to be simple, low-configuration, reliable, and high-quality.

## Is Timber For Me?

* You want simple real-time access to your logs without all of the fuss.
* You don't want to spend time tinkering with parsing rules and indexing strategies.
* Managing logging pipelines is not a good use of your time.
* You desire rich structured logs but it's not clear how to achieve this.

## What Makes Timber Different?

* \*\*\*\*[**Better Integrations**](usage/integrations/) - Timber is not an observer of your log data, it is active participant in its collection. Timber improves the quality of your log data through thoughtful integrations. See our [Ruby integration](usage/integrations/ruby.md) for an example.
* **Low Configuration** - Timber knows your platform, language, and the data you're sending it. Timber is designed to feel curated out of the box and does not require copious amounts of configuration to get started.
* **Simple** - Timber is designed for simple, reliable, real-time access to your logs. Timber's focus is on the real-time use case and it's why our live tailing feature stands out.
