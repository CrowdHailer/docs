# What Is Timber?

![](.gitbook/assets/logo-purple.png)

[Timber](https://timber.io/) is a hosted service for aggregating logs across your entire stack - [any language](setup/languages/), [any platform](setup/platforms/), [any data source](setup/log-forwarders/). Timber was designed with a strong focus on simplicity, real-time log access, and providing a high-quality developer experience. Key features of Timber include:

* \*\*\*\*[**Context**](under-the-hood/integration-philosophy.md) - Timber is only as good as your log data. This is why Timber's integrations capture and augment your logs with useful context. See our [Ruby integration](setup/languages/ruby/) for an example.
* **Low Configuration** - Immediately useful, does not require copious amounts of configuration to begin using.
* **Strong Structured Data Support** - Timber has _strong_ structured data support and is very powerful in that context. See our [Dynamic Schema Management](under-the-hood/schema-maintenance.md), [Live Tailing](usage/live-tailing.md),  [SQL Querying](usage/sql-querying.md), and [Structured Logging Best Practices](guides/structured-logging-best-practices.md) documents.
* \*\*\*\*[**Sub-Second Live Tail**](usage/live-tailing.md) - Timber ingests data and makes it available in under a second, providing you with true real-time access to your logs, making Timber useful in a [live tail](usage/live-tailing.md) capacity.
