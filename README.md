![](.gitbook/assets/logo-purple.png)

[Timber](https://timber.io/) is a hosted service for aggregating logs across your entire stack - [any language, any platform, any data source](usage/integrations/). Timber is built to be simple and reliable with a focus on real-time access to your log data.

## Is Timber For Me?

* You want simple real-time access to your logs without all of the fuss.
* You don't want to spend time tinkering with parsing rules and indexing strategies.
* Managing logging pipelines is not a good use of your time.
* You desire rich structured logs but it's not clear how to achieve this.

## What Makes Timber Different?

* \*\*\*\*[**Better Integrations**](usage/integrations/) - Timber is not an observer of your log data, it is active participant in its collection. Timber improves your log data through it's integrations. See our [Ruby integration](usage/integrations/ruby.md) for an example.
* **Low Configuration** - Timber knows your platform, language, and the data you're sending it. Timber will feel curated out of the box and will not require copious amounts of configuration to get started.
* **Simple** - Timber is designed to be simple and reliable with a strong focus on real-time access of your log data. Timber's focus is not on edge-case or complex logging use cases.
