# What Is Timber?



![](.gitbook/assets/logo-purple.png)

[Timber](https://timber.io/) is a hosted service for aggregating logs across your entire stack - [any language, any platform, any data source](setup/integrations/). Timber is built to be simple and reliable with a focus on real-time access to your log data.

## Is Timber For Me?

* You want simple real-time access to your logs without all of the fuss.
* You don't want to spend time tinkering with parsing rules and indexing strategies.
* Managing logging pipelines is not a good use of your time.
* You desire rich structured logs but it's not clear how to achieve this.

## What Makes Timber Different?

* \*\*\*\*[**Better Integrations**](setup/integrations/) - Timber is not an observer of your log data, it is active participant in its collection. Timber improves your log data through it's integrations. See our [Ruby integration](setup/integrations/ruby.md) for an example.
* **Less Configuration** - Timber knows your platform and language, making Timber curated out of the box without the need for copious amounts of configuration. For most cases, Timber should not require custom parsing rules and filters.
* **Structured Logging Support** - While Timber works great with traditional text-based logs, it is best experienced with structured logs. Timber has very strong structured data support and is powerful in that context. See our [dynamic schema management](under-the-hood/schema-maintenance.md) and [structured logging best practice](setup/guides/event-naming.md) documents.
