# What Is Timber?

![](.gitbook/assets/logo-purple.png)

[Timber](https://timber.io/) is a hosted service for aggregating logs across your entire stack - [any language, any platform, any data source](usage/integrations/). Timber was built with a strong focus on developer productivity. It is designed to be low configuration and immediately useful.

## Is Timber For Me?

* You don't want to spend time tinkering with parsing rules and indexing strategies.
* Managing logging pipelines does not align with your core competency.
* You desire rich structured logs but it's not clear how to achieve this.
* You want simple real-time access to your logs without all of the fuss.

## What Makes Timber Different?

* \*\*\*\*[**Quality Integrations**](usage/integrations/) - Quality data collection trumps parsing. This is why Timber goes the extra mile with its integrations. Timber is not an observer of your log data, it is active participant in its collection. See our [Ruby integration](usage/integrations/ruby.md) for an example.
* **Low Configuration** - Timber knows your platform, language, and the data you're sending it. When you first log in, Timber will feel curated and immediately useful. Timber does not require copious amounts of configuration to begin extracting value.
* **Top-Down Design** - Timber is designed top-down, starting with the user experience. Timber's focus in on helping you quickly surface valuable insights from your log data. While we are proud of our [architecture](under-the-hood/architecture.md), it is not what we highlight to our users.
