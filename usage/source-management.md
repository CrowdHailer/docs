# Source Management

Timber's source management section lets you manage all aspects of your log sources.

A "source" is simply a source of log data. For example, a Kubernetes cluster, Linux server, log file, Ruby app, or a AWS Lambda function are all examples of sources within Timber. It is purposefully generic and anything that contains log data is a valid source.

## Getting Started

1. [Open the Timber web app](https://app.timber.io).
2. Navigate to the Sources section using the [main navigation](../clients/web-app/#2-main-navigation).
3. Click the "Add Source" button.
4. Select your [language](../setup/languages/), [platform](../setup/platforms/), [log forwarder](../setup/log-forwarders/), or [operating system](../setup/operating-systems/). Whichever method you prefer to send your log data to Timber.
5. Click the link to open the appropriate integration instructions.
6. Follow the instructions to integrate Timber.
7. Verify log delivery.
