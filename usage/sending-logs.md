# Sending Logs

Using Timber starts with sending your logs to the Timber service. This guide walks through the various steps to complete that as quickly as possible.

## 1. Integrate With Timber

If you haven't done so already, head over to the integrations section and follow the installation instruction for your desired platform.

{% page-ref page="../setup/integrations/" %}

## 2. Format Your Logs

Timber recognizes hundreds of log formats, and for most users integrating is simply enough. Timber will parse and structure your data. If this is not the case you'll need to update the format of your logs to conform to one of our support formats.
