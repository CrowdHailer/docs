# Alerting

Timber offers powerful threshold based alerting on your log data, allowing you to be notified when certain conditions are met.

## Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
**Before you begin:** Your account comes with a default "All Admin" notification destination which will send an email to all [members](account-management/team-management.md) with the [admin role](account-management/role-based-access-control.md#permissions). This is the same destination that Timber send its system notices. If you'd like to add more destinations, please see the 
{% endhint %}

1. [Open the Timber web app.](https://app.timber.io)
2. Navigate to the Alerts section using the [main navigation](../clients/web-app/#2-main-navigation).
3. Click the "Create Alert" button.
4. Fill out the [form fields](alerting.md#fields) with your alert details.
5. Click "Save Changes"
