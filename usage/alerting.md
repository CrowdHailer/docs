# Alerting

Timber offers a powerful threshold based alerting system, allowing you to be notified when certain conditions are met.

## Getting Started

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Web App" %}
1. [Open the Timber web app](https://app.timber.io).
2. Navigate to the Alerts section using the [main navigation](../clients/web-app/#2-main-navigation).
3. Click the "Create Alert" button.
4. Fill out the form with your alert details.
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. You will be notified on your chosen notification destination when the alert threshold is crossed.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CLI" %}
{% hint style="warning" %}
Managing alerts is currently not supported in the [Timber CLI](../clients/cli/).
