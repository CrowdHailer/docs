# Ruby

Timber integrates with Ruby through its [`timber` Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/timber). The Timber Ruby library features:

* An interface that mimics the core Ruby `Logger` library exactly, making it easy to integrate without code level changes.
* Performant, light-weight, and thoughtful design.
* Support for structured logging.
* Support for context.
* Automatic context capturing.
* Integration with popular 3rd party libraries, such as Rails and Rack.
