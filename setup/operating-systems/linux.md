# Linux

Timber integrates with the various [Linux](https://www.linux.com/) operating systems \([Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), and more\) through a variety of [log forwarders](../log-forwarders/). We recommend [Fluent Bit](../log-forwarders/fluent-bit.md) due to it's performance and efficiency, but you are welcome to use any of the [supported log forwarders](../log-forwarders/).
