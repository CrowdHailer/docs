# Language Libraries

Timber offers official language level integrations through the form of libraries. What makes Timber's libraries unique is that they go beyond simply shipping data to the Timber service by providing an interface for logging structured data. To get started, select your language below:

{% page-ref page="../setup/integrations/elixir/" %}

{% page-ref page="../setup/integrations/node.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../setup/integrations/ruby.md" %}

### Don't see your language?

No problem! Timber works great with logs of any type. We recommend shipping logs directly from your platform. Check out our [integrations](../setup/integrations/) for more information.
